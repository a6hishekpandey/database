## ‚öôÔ∏è ACID Properties

**Transaction:**  
A group of SQL queries treated as a single unit of work.

**Atomicity:**  
All operations in a transaction must complete successfully. If one fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

**Consistency:**  
Ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction (e.g., referential integrity using foreign keys).

**Isolation:**  
Prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other.

### ‚û§ Read Phenomena (Problems due to low isolation):
- **Dirty Read:** Reading uncommitted changes from another transaction.
- **Non-repeatable Read:** Same query returns different results if another transaction modifies the data in between.
- **Phantom Read:** New rows appear in results when re-running the same query (e.g., new row inserted in a range).
- **Lost Update:** Two transactions overwrite each other's updates (e.g., `count++` logic).

### ‚û§ Isolation Levels:
- **Read Uncommitted:** Can read uncommitted data ‚Üí dirty reads possible.
- **Read Committed:** Only committed data is visible ‚Üí no dirty reads. (Default in most DBs.)
- **Repeatable Read:** Same row returns consistent values throughout the transaction ‚Üí prevents non-repeatable reads.
- **Snapshot (MVCC):** Transaction sees a snapshot of the DB as it was at the start.
- **Serializable:** Strictest isolation ‚Üí no concurrent transactions; behaves like transactions are run one after the other.

**Durability:**  
Once a transaction is committed, its data is persisted‚Äîeven after a crash or power failure.

---

## üîÑ Eventual Consistency

- Often seen in master-slave (leader-follower) setups.
- Writes go to the master; updates are pushed asynchronously to slaves.
- Reads from slaves might be slightly outdated. If you always want the latest data, make sure to read from the master.

---

## üìä Database Indexing

**What is an Index?**  
A data structure that improves read performance by allowing faster lookups.

**Important Concepts:**
- Indexes point to rows in the heap (actual data). If data is too large or not selective, the DB may skip the index to avoid overhead.
- Indexes **don‚Äôt store all columns**, so fetching non-indexed columns requires additional table reads.

### ‚û§ Scan Types:
- **Index Scan:** Uses index to locate matching rows.
- **Bitmap Scan:** Used when index scan is too inefficient but full table scan is overkill.

### üîë Key vs Non-Key Index:
- **Non-Key Index (Covering Index):** Includes additional columns used for filtering to avoid heap reads.

### ‚ûï Composite Index:
- One index on multiple columns.
- Useful when filtering/sorting on multiple columns (especially with `AND` conditions).
- **Column order matters**: Index is effective from left to right.

> Use composite index when filtering/sorting with multiple columns.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Avoid UUID (v4) as Index:**  
- Random distribution leads to poor B+Tree performance and high write overhead due to frequent rebalancing.

## üìÇ Secondary Index

- Created on non-clustered (non-ordered) columns.
- Even though the column isn‚Äôt ordered in the table, the index itself is ordered (B+Tree).
- Comes with overhead on writes (due to B+Tree rebalancing).

## üß† What is a Bitmap Index?
A **bitmap index** uses bitmaps (bit arrays) to represent the presence or absence of a value in a column.

- Each distinct value gets a **bitmap vector**.
- Each bit represents a row:
  - `1` = row has the value
  - `0` = row doesn't

### Example:
Column: `status` with values `"active"` and `"inactive"`

- `active`  ‚Üí `[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]`
- `inactive` ‚Üí `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`

---

## üîç What is a Bitmap Index Scan?

A **Bitmap Index Scan** is an index scan strategy that:

- Scans indexes to **generate bitmaps** of matching rows.
- **Combines** bitmaps (e.g., with AND/OR).
- **Converts** the final bitmap into a list of row IDs.
- Performs a **Bitmap Heap Scan** to fetch actual rows.

---

## üì¶ When Is It Used?

- Multiple conditions on **different columns**.
  - e.g., `WHERE gender = 'M' AND age = 25`
- Queries on **low-cardinality (unique values) columns**.
- **Large datasets** with filtering on indexed columns.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works ‚Äì Step by Step

Given:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = 'M' AND age = 30;
```

Assume bitmap indexes exist on `gender` and `age`.
- Bitmap Index Scan on `gender = 'M'`
    - Bitmap: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`
- Bitmap Index Scan on `age = 30`
    - Bitmap: `[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]`
- Bitmap AND
    - Result: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`
- Bitmap Heap Scan
    - Fetch rows 3 and 5 from the table

## üìå PostgreSQL Example (EXPLAIN Output)

Given:
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 2 AND status = 'active';
```

Output:
```text
Bitmap Heap Scan on employees
  Recheck Cond: (department_id = 2 AND status = 'active')
  -> BitmapAnd
       -> Bitmap Index Scan on idx_department_id  (condition: department_id = 2)
       -> Bitmap Index Scan on idx_status         (condition: status = 'active')
```

## üß† Quick Notes: 

### üéØ Why Bitmap Indexes Are Suitable Only for Low-Cardinality Columns?

### 1. üì¶ One Bitmap per Distinct Value
- Bitmap index creates **one bitmap per unique value** in a column.
- More unique values = more bitmaps = more memory consumption.

### 2. üíæ Memory Usage Grows Fast
- Each bitmap has 1 bit per row.
- For high-cardinality columns (e.g. `email`, `user_id`), bitmap index size becomes huge.
- Example:
  - 1 million rows * 3 unique values ‚Üí ~375 KB
  - 1 million rows * 100,000 unique values ‚Üí ~12.5 GB ‚ùó
  
### üéØ Why Recheck Condition Is Required After BitmapAnd in PostgreSQL?
- Recheck Condition is needed because bitmaps operate at the page level, not always the row level.

## üìÅ Database Partitioning

**What is Partitioning?**  
Splitting a large table horizontally into smaller chunks (partitions) based on a column value (e.g., date range).

**Benefits:**
- Queries can target specific partitions ‚Üí improves performance.
- Indexes are created **per partition**, making scans faster if pruning is enabled.

**Notes:**
- Partition key should be **NOT NULL**.
- Indexes must be defined per partition.
- **Enable partition pruning** to let the DB skip unnecessary partitions.
- Updating rows that move across partitions is costly.

---

## üîÄ Database Sharding

**What is Sharding?**  
Dividing one large database into multiple smaller databases (shards), each with a portion of the data.

**Sharding Key:**  
Used to determine which shard holds the data (via consistent hashing).

**Partitioning vs Sharding:**
- **Partitioning:** Splits one table across multiple internal partitions in the same DB.
- **Sharding:** Splits entire DB into smaller independent databases.

**Pros:**
1. Scalability
2. Smaller indexes
3. Security and access control

**Cons:**
1. No transaction support across shards
2. Difficult to update schema
3. Hard to do joins across shards

> Use sharding **only when absolutely needed** due to its complexity.

---

## üîí Locks & Concurrency

- **Exclusive Lock:** No one else can read or write the locked row.
- **Shared Lock:** Others can read but not write.

### üîÅ Double Booking Problem (e.g., seat booking system)
- Use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to avoid race conditions and make sure the first transaction that locks the ticket gets it.

---

## üìÑ Pagination

- **Offset-based pagination is slow** for large datasets because DB must scan the (`OFFSET` + `LIMIT`) number of rows and then discard `OFFSET` rows before returning the `LIMIT` results.
- Consider **keyset pagination** (using a `WHERE id > last_seen_id`) for better performance.

---

## üåê Database Replication

**Master-Slave Replication:**
- **Master:** Handles all writes and syncs data to slaves.
- **Slaves:** Serve read-only traffic (can lag behind master).

**Types:**
- **Asynchronous:** Slaves eventually catch up.
- **Semi-Async:** Master waits for at least one slave to confirm.
- **Synchronous:** Master waits for all slaves (rare, slow).

**Pros:**
1. Horizontal scaling
2. Region based queries - DB per region

**Cons:**
1. Eventual consistency
2. Slow synchronous writes

## üÜö SQL vs NoSQL

| Feature | **SQL (Relational DB)** | **NoSQL (Non-relational DB)** |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Data Model** | Structured (tables, rows, columns) | Flexible (documents, key-value, graph, etc.) |
| **Schema** | Fixed schema (predefined structure) | Dynamic schema (schema-less) |
| **Query Language** | SQL (Structured Query Language) | Varies by DB (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-like queries) |
| **ACID Compliance** | Strong | Often relaxed; prefers eventual consistency |
| **Scalability** | Vertical (scale up: stronger server) | Horizontal (scale out: more servers) |
| **Joins** | Powerful support for joins | Limited or no joins (denormalization is preferred) |
| **Use Case** | Complex queries, transactional systems (e.g., banking) | High scalability, fast reads/writes, flexible data (e.g., social media) |

---

## üß† Concurrency Control

- **Optimistic Locking:** No locks; uses a version column to detect conflicts.
- **Pessimistic Locking:** Locks the row to prevent conflicts (`FOR UPDATE`).

### ‚úÖ How Optimistic Locking Works:

**Read:**  
   - Fetch a record with a version number.
   - e.g., `version = 4`.

**Edit:**  
   - User modifies the data.

**Write:**  
   - When saving, issue an `UPDATE` with a condition on the version:
     ```sql
     UPDATE posts
     SET title = 'New Title', version = 5
     WHERE id = 123 AND version = 4;
     ```
   - DB updates only if the version hasn‚Äôt changed.

**Conflict:**  
   - If version doesn't match (record has changed), the update **fails**.
   - The application handles the failure (e.g., prompt user to reload).

### üí° Ideal For:

- High-concurrency systems
- Stateless apps (e.g., web apps)
- Systems using connection pools
- 3-tier architectures (app ‚Üí API ‚Üí DB)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è When It Fails:

- Multiple users read same version
- One updates ‚Üí succeeds
- Others ‚Üí fail with version mismatch

## üîí Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking

| Feature | **Optimistic** | **Pessimistic** |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Locks | No locks | Uses row/table locks |
| Conflicts | Detected at write time | Prevented at read time |
| Performance | Better for reads | Safer for critical writes |
| Use Case | Web apps, APIs | Banking, critical systems |
